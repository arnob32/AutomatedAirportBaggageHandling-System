# Automated-Airport-Baggage-Handling-System.
This project simulates an automated airport luggage system using AGVs, managing baggage transport, task assignment, queuing, and smart charging to improve efficiency, coordination, and overall airport baggage-handling performance.

# project Overview
This project models an automated airport luggage management system using autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs). It simulates baggage transport, task scheduling, queue management, and intelligent charging across a busy airport environment. The system coordinates multiple AGVs to enhance efficiency, reduce congestion, and improve overall baggage-handling reliability. Through modular Java components, it demonstrates how automation can optimize modern airport operations.
