# Automated Airport Baggage Handling System.
This project simulates an automated airport luggage system using AGVs, managing baggage transport, task assignment, queuing, and smart charging to improve efficiency, coordination, and overall airport baggage-handling performance.

# Project Overview
This project models an automated airport luggage management system using autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs). It simulates baggage transport, task scheduling, queue management, and intelligent charging across a busy airport environment. The system coordinates multiple AGVs to enhance efficiency, reduce congestion, and improve overall baggage-handling reliability. Through modular Java components, it demonstrates how automation can optimize modern airport operations.

# Why This System Is Effective
  1. Improved Efficiency: AGVs streamline baggage movement, reducing delays and speeding up processing.
  2. Higher Reliability: Automated coordination minimizes human error and ensures consistent performance.
  3. Smart Resource Use: Intelligent task assignment and charging keep AGVs available and productive.
  4. Reduced Congestion: Queue and traffic management prevent bottlenecks in busy airport areas.
  5. Scalable & Flexible: The system can easily adapt to different airport sizes and workload demands.

# Benefits / Impact
  1. Highlight improvements over manual systems:
  2. Faster operations
  3. Safer and more consistent
  4. Scalable for future airport automation

# Limitations 
Shows awareness of scope:
  1. Simulation-based
  2. No real hardware integration
  3. Simplified movement model
